To participate in a prize draw each one gives his/her firstname.

Each letter of a firstname has a value which is its rank in the English alphabet. 
A and a have rank 1, B and b rank 2 and so on.

The length of the firstname is added to the sum of these ranks hence a number som.

An array of random weights is linked to the firstnames and
each som is multiplied by its corresponding weight to get what they call a winning number.

names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"
weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]

PauL -> som = length of firstname + 16 + 1 + 21 + 12 = 4 + 50 -> 54
The *weight* associated with PauL is 2 so PauL's *winning number* is 54 * 2 = 108.

Now one can sort the firstnames in decreasing order of the winning numbers.
When two people have the same winning number sort them alphabetically by their firstnames.

parameters: st a string of firstnames, we an array of weights, n a rank

return: the firstname of the participant whose rank is n (ranks are numbered from 1)

names: "COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH"
weights: [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1]
n: 4

The function should return: "PauL"

Notes: 
The weight array is at least as long as the number of names, it can be longer.

If st is empty return "No participants".

If n is greater than the number of participants then return "Not enough participants".

See Examples Test Cases for more examples.



My code
function rank(st, we, n) {
  const som = st.split(",")
  const arr = []
  const brr = []
  for(let i=0; i<som.length; i++){
    if(st === ''){
      return "No participants"
    } if(n>som.length){
      return "Not enough participants"
    }
    const leng = som[i].length
    const change = som[i].toLowerCase().match(/[a-z]/gi).map((el) => el.charCodeAt()-96).reduce((pre,cur) => pre+cur)
    const point = (leng+change)*we[i]
    arr.push(point)
    brr.push(point)
  }
  console.log(som)
  console.log(arr)
  console.log(brr)
  const num = arr.indexOf(brr.sort((a,b) => b-a)[n-1])
  if (num >=2){
    
  }
  console.log(num)
  return som[num]
}

//console.log(rank("COLIN,AMANDBA,AMANDAB,CAROL,PauL,JOSEPH", [1, 4, 4, 5, 2, 1], 4))
console.log(rank("Emily,Madison,Robert,Addison,Mia,Liam,Samantha,Lagon,Ava,Emma,Andrew,Isabella,Natalie,Aiden,Alexander,William,Chloe,Elizabeth,Grace,Sophia,Avery,Willaim,Mason,Jacob", [6,2,1,3,1,4,1,2,2,2,3,2,6,3,5,2,4,6,3,5,2,3,2,3], 18))
